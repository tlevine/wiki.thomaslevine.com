Tom wants this stuff.
====================

## The perfect day bag
I haven't figured out what this is yet.

## A fast and portable laptop.
* Big battery
* Lots of RAM
* Cool-running CPU
* No hard drive---SSD or SD card instead
* No fans
* Light

I plan on buying a broken one and replacement parts,
so if you have broken a nice laptop, I could possibly
use it.

## Mended pants
I have two nice pairs of pants with not-so-nice holes.

## Public records
* Information about data catalog purchases, maintenance, and usage
* Anything about Scarsdale

## Bureaucratic
* Submit applications for grants, conferences, &c.
* 

## Lodging
* Sleeping surfaces anywhere any time
* A roommate who is into my temporary sublet scheme
