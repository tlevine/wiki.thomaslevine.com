## Desktop computers
I have two bespoke, artisinal, quiet, hand-crafted-with-love
desktop computers.

One is in an Antec P180 Mini case. It has 16 gigabytes of RAM,
a good CPU, and quiet fans. I don't think it has any disk drives.
It has lots of room or disk drives and PCI cards.

One has an Akasa Euler case. It has an SSD and no room for disk
drives. It presently has no wireless network ability, but I have
a wireless network card that might work with it. It has no moving
parts, so it's pretty quiet.

## Networking
I have multiple routers and wireless network cards.

## Books
I have lots of books, mainly on statistics, ergonomics, and typography.
